# EM Algorithms

Imagine a situation: you have a set of patients' age data, the data is well sorted from young to old. Now because of an accident, some data are missing, and the doctor wants the mean and standard deviation of patient's age distribution, which we know, it should be a normal distribution. Now how to recover the true parameters of this normal distribution with trauncted data.
